<!--
Thanks for your contribution!

Please take a quick look at those things down there. They're quite important.
Really! We wrote them for you. Yes you! With utmost care. Read them.

**For short term contributors:** We understand that getting your commits well
defined like we require is a hard task and takes some learning. If you
look to help without wanting to contribute long term there's no need
for you to learn this. Just drop us a message and we'll take care of brushing
up your stuff for merge!
